# Stock Prediction
Nowadays, forecasting stock prices and volatility is crucial for investors, traders, and financial analysts. In this repo, I use a variety of methods, from traditional statistical models (ARIMA, GARCH), Machine Learning algorithms (Gaussian Process) to Deep Learning model Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

This approach helps me practice what I've learnt and reexamine assumptions about the strengths and limitations mentioned in surveys on time series.
