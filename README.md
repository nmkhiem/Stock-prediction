# Stock Prediction
Nowadays, forecasting stock prices and volatility is crucial for investors, traders, and financial analysts. In this repo, I use a variety of methods, from traditional statistical models (ARIMA, GARCH), Machine Learning algorithms (Gaussian Process) to Deep Learning model Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

In the future, I am aiming to explore models capable of long-term prediction such as Transformer and its variants:

- Convolutional Attention on Postion Encoding (2020): https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00235
- Informer (2020): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07436
- Autoformer (2021): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13008
- FEDformer (2022): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12740
- SpaceTimeformer (2023): https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12218

This helps me practice what I've learnt and reexamine assumptions about the strengths and limitations mentioned in surveys on time series.
